- Student name: Piet Jacobs
- Github repo: <https://github.com/HoGentTIN/elnx-1920-sme-PietJ95.git>

Setting up basic automated installation for all upcoming servers

## Test plan

- All tests need to pass
- Verify that surfing to https://192.0.2.10/wordpress shows the wordpress website and that it is using https
- Connect via ssh and verify that you can login to the mariadb service with
```
    mysql -u root -pRo0tP4sS
```

- If logging in works, now check that the wordpress db is present by entering:

```
    show databases;
```
